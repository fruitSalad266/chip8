# chip8 emulator
This is an emulator (or more accurately an interpreter) for the interpreted programming language [CHIP8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8). 

I followed this [tutorial](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator) for the spec. I thought it was very helpful because it's all conceptual and leaves you to figure out a lot on your own. I also used [@CoreDumped](https://www.youtube.com/@CoreDumpped) for a lot of the ground-up knowledge for how a computer works.

### Things that I learned:
- I strongly dislike super primitives
- How did someone ever come up with this for the first time?
- It is (in hindsight) not that hard to make rocks think 

### Copyright
I mean what is there to copy even
